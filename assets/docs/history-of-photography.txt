The word photography is a neologism of two Greek words, 

The word “photography” was created from the Greek roots φωτός (phōto’s), genitive of φῶς (phōs), “light” and γραφή (graphé) “representation by means of lines”. 

The first time the word -photography- was used was in 1839 and Sir John Herschel for which history credits Sir John Herschel. 

Herschel 

The Chinese were the first people that we know of to write about and prepare diagrams of the camera obscura. These Latin words literally mean "dark room". The first known record of the camera obscura is in writing by Chinese philosopher Mo-tzu in 400BC.

Later that century, Greek philosopher Aristotle realized that an eclipse could be viewed by looking at the ground under a tree, through the cover of leaves as a sieve of lenses.


        "Why is it the case that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth?

        Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?"

11th century, Middle-Eastern polymath Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) made astounding contributions to the principles of optics. Alhazen studied and discovered the correct model of vision, formulated the laws of reflection, and investigated refraction. In "On the Shape of the Eclipse" he discusses the camera obscura and introduces the viewing screen to view the inverted image.

Leonardo Da Vinci proposed that the human eye functions like a camera obscura four centuries later.

Artists throughout history have used the camera obscura or similar devices to aid their practice. There is little evidence but no rationale discouraging the possibility that some of the great Renaissance painters in Art History used optical devices to enhance their art and speed up production.

Artists and scientists continued to develop the technology of the camera obscura across centuries to increase mobility, accuracy, and understanding the phenomena and possibilities of light.

The camera obscura was made by "portable" by the 1700s by crafting a box with a pinhole on one side and a glass screen on te other. Light shining through the aperture would project onto the glass screen where the artist could trace by hand. Sharper images were soon discovered when the pinhole was replaced by a small lens.

While the camera obscura is developing through the centuries, there is simultaneous discovery happening around light-sensitive materials.

More than 2000 years prior to the invention of the camera obscura, on the Eastern shores of the Mediterranean, the Phoenician people knew that a certain snails left a yellow slime that turned purple in the sunlight. Without this discovery of light-sensitivity we might not have the photography we have today. 

Fast-forward to 1727, German professor, Johann Heinrich Schulze, observed that silver salts darkened when exposed to light. He did not pursue image making with this discovery. That realization and actualization would come from a later generation of artists.

In 1800, English chemist Thomas Wedgewood, was making "sun pictures" by placing leaves on leather that he treated with silver salts - but these images were unfixed and would continue to fade to black.

The birth of photography was still missing two critical discoveries:
1. a way to combine light-sensitive material with the camera obscura device
2. a way to make an image permanent

In 1826, "view from the window at le gras, france" was made and photography was born. Joseph Nicephore niepce put a plate coated with bitumen / asphaltum (an asphalt used in ancient times as cement) and placed the coated plate in a camera obscura. The camera, facing out his window, exposed the plate for 8 hours. 
<a href="./assets/images/josephniepce.jpeg"></a>

Niepce began sharing his findings with Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre. Daguerre owned a theatre in Paris and would make a tremendous impact on photography's future in 1835 2 years after Niepce died.

Daguerre found that the chemical compound silver iodide was much more sensitive to light than Niepce's bitumen. He put a copper plate coated with silver iodide in a camera obscura, exposed this plate to light for a shirt time, then to fumes of mercury and an image appeared. The image still had issues and would darken over time. In 1837 a new discovery provides a solution to this darkening by washing away the silver iodide with warm water and table salt.

This process would come to be known as the Daguerrotype.

Since this process involves Mercury it poses serious health issues and is not commonly practiced anymore.


This entangled lineage of science and art puts the camera obscura as one of the greatest agents of change for art in recorded history.

CONTEMPORARY PINHOLE
Michael Wesely, German
Uses extremely long camera exposures, typically 2-3 years, to create images of urban development that span space and time. Wesely's technique includes using extremely small apertures and filters to reduce the amount of light passing onto the film.
